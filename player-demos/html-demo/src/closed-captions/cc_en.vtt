00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.960
Showing intricate and fascinating structures

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:39.280
that scientists are still trying to fully understand.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.780
Inverse.

00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:57.521
Hi, and, welcome to the holocaust but previous episodes we've looked at a lot of

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.010
...villages of planetary nebula and...talked about how they tell us about the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.080
ultimate fate of our own songs now in this episode we're

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.910
going to take a closer look at just one of the planetary nebula that from

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.740
like many others...in fact...anything in life that planet.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.300
Known by its catalogue number

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.180
...five one eight nine.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:32.180
This planetary nebula might not sound very exciting.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.100
When it was discovered in the nineteenth-century

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.020
the telescopes of today could benny may count any structure?

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.600
That advances in telescope technology over a century into

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.440
...have borne fruit.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.380
For a long-time the best image of this object was from the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.190
europeans seven observatories mc tune which reveals energy

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.590
seen five one eight nine complex...

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.770
Then came...remarkable picture from the eighth

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.900
meters gemini self telescope but if you point...latin.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.190
Well, if you point hub of it when you get to see some truly spectacular

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.070
detail culture which has never been seen before.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.550
And, that's of course due to hubble's unique vantage point above the earth's atmosphere

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.410
now if we zooming close which we can...hubble's high-resolution

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.940
we start seeing these very dense not in the clouds of gas.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:43.480
Problem...before most famously in the helix maybe...

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.360
Now what's going on here is that the radiation from the dying

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.240
...carving these notes into shape forming these

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.410
growing file wave like patterns much like water flowing around

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:02.280
the role industry and these are all pointing towards the center of the nebula.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.860
The notes and energy

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.870
...five one eight nine reminder of just...being.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.380
They might look insignificant here but they are actually a similar

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.910
signs to the intelligence services system.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.660
This star at the center of the nebula...whites tool.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.610
Is far too small to see is anything other than a

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.490
point of light even though it is roughly the size of the earth?

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.020
And, you see a five one eight nine

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.780
spiral shape is perhaps its most obvious feature leading to its nickname

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.750
...this spiral planetary nebula the structures reminiscent of water coming

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.380
from lawn sprinkler is probably due to the start rotating and what

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.420
willing as...matter similar structures have been seen before

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.080
especially in planetary maybe with binary stars at the sentence?

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.460
But, whether there are two stars or just the one at the center of engine

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.150
...one eight nine remains an open question so it

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.810
shape and the signs that lies behind it remain a fascinating area for

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.980
astronomers to study this is doctor...signing...for the holocaust once again

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:56.830
...surprise us beyond our wildest imagination.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.740
Now that you've caught up with hubble make sure to get the latest from the ground to the east

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.020
...highlights the best of the european southern observatory and

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.560
it's powerful telescopes that observed from high in the chilean andy's at

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.740
the southern hemisphere is best known sites for astronomical observations.
